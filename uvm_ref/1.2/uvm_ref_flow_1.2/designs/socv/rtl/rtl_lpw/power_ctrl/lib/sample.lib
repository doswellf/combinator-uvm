 *** Description: This library is intended for use in running the FAST  ***
 *** tutorial. The numbers in this design are arbitrary and represent   ***
 *** technology several generations past. The use of these numbers is   ***
 *** to avoid comparisson against existing technology libraries.        ***

 *** 1.0b Rev2 : Removed RS flop that was causing fatals.               ***
 *** 1.0b Rev3 : Corrected error in original RS flop and put back.      ***
 *** 1.0b Rev4 : Scaled all Cap and Delay values to 10% or original to  ***
 ***             prevent confussion with customers when looking at      ***
 ***             Delay Values.                                          ***
 *** 1.0b Rev5 : Added new op_cond, wire_loads, and wire_load_selection ***
